            To accomplish these goals, the data link layer takes the packets it gets from the network layer
            and encapsulates them into frames for transmission. Each frame contains a frame header, a
            payload field for holding the packet, and a frame trailer, as illustrated in Fig.1. Frame
            management forms the heart of what the data link layer does
